Why \"Hello World\" ? <br></p>\n<p>Because it is SPECIAL. I think almost everyone who knows programming have made \"Hello World\" string\nfor their first compiled program, no matter what programming languange you're using, most likely the\nfirst compiled program is \"Hello World\". It's easy, very simple, and really straightforward. And that's what makes\n\"Hello World\" special. <br></p>\n<p>Enough with the title (well that's not the topic of this blog anyway *lol*). In this blog post\ni want to tell you about this site.</p>\n<h3>Why ?</h3>\n<p>Why am i making this site ? well i'm not 'literally' built this site, this site license is belongs to\n<a href=\"https://brittanychiang.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Brittany Chiang</a> (thanks to her for building this awesome personal site). \"Then who are you ?\"\nMe ? I'm the one who redesigned it, even though not much because i really like the default design of this site, i'm not\neven change the color scheme, just redesign a few components and adding skillsets and blog sections. <br><br>\nAnyway the main reason is because recently i just decided to start working freelance. Actually i have done some freelance works,\nbut just for local client (my friends, my neighbor, etc), but this time i want to try the <a href=\"https://upwork.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Upwork</a> platform,\nwhich is a Global Platform. So in order to gain more attention (even though i'm not having 'real-work' experience) i decided to have personal site.</p>\n<h3>How ?</h3>\n<p>This site is built using <a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Gatsby</a> which based on <a href=\"https://reactjs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ReactJS</a>. And believe it or not,\ni have literally have no idea how to use Gatsby, and also have '0'-knowledge with ReactJS (*lol*). But because i really\nlike this personal site and wanted to have a personal site, so i'm forcing myself to learn about this technologies, and because\nit's basically Javascript based, so it only took me about two to three days to learn. At first i just trying random things,\nthen i  started to understand of how this works (like routing, styling, components, configs, etc).\n<br></p>\n<p>There's something i learned here, about making this site. That if you already know the basic, you will understand the different\nversion of that basic knowledge, or if it was too advanced and you need to learn about that, you're likely will not having any\nissues learning about that. <br></p>\n<h3>Can i use this code for my own website ?</h3>\n<p>Yeah sure. And of course with <strong>attribution</strong>. Linked to the repository or the site itself.</p>\n<h3>How can i install it ?</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Download this project by direcly visiting the <a href=\"https://github.com/kurnyaannn/kurnyaannn.github.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">page</a> or clone this project\nusing git</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong> : The default branch for this repo is '<strong>dev</strong>'.

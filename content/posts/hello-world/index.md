## Hi there!

This is my first weblog, so it's kinda special, but. Why "Hello World" ? <br>

Because it is SPECIAL. I think almost everyone who knows programming have made "Hello World" string
for their first compiled program, no matter what programming languange you're using, most likely the
first compiled program is "Hello World". It's easy, very simple, and really straightforward. And that's what makes
"Hello World" special. <br>

Enough with the title (well that's not the topic of this blog anyway \*lol\*). In this blog post
i want to tell you about this site.

### Why ?

Why am i making this site ? well i'm not 'literally' built this site, this site license is belongs to
[Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com) (thanks to her for building this awesome personal site). "Then who are you ?"
Me ? I'm the one who redesigned it, even though not much because i really like the default design of this site, i'm not
even change the color scheme, just redesign a few components and adding skillsets and blog sections. <br><br>
Anyway the main reason is because recently i just decided to start working freelance. Actually i have done some freelance works,
but just for local client (my friends, my neighbor, etc), but this time i want to try the [Upwork](https://upwork.com) platform,
which is a Global Platform. So in order to gain more attention (even though i'm not having 'real-work' experience) i decided to have personal site.

### How ?

This site is built using [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) which based on [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org). And believe it or not,
i have literally have no idea how to use Gatsby, and also have '0'-knowledge with ReactJS (\*lol\*). But because i really
like this personal site and wanted to have a personal site, so i'm forcing myself to learn about this technologies, and because
it's basically Javascript based, so it only took me about two to three days to learn. At first i just trying random things,
then i started to understand of how this works (like routing, styling, components, configs, etc).
<br>

There's something i learned here, about making this site. That if you already know the basic, you will understand the different
version of that basic knowledge, or if it was too advanced and you need to learn about that, you're likely will not having any
issues learning about that. <br>

### Can i use this code for my own website ?

Yeah sure. And of course with **attribution**. Linked to the repository or the site itself.

### How can i install it ?

1. Download this project by directly visiting the [page](https://github.com/kurnyaannn/kurnyaannn.github.io) or clone this project using git clone
   > **NOTE** : The default branch for this repo is '**dev**'. Make sure you're cloning the correct branch

```shell
$ git clone 'https://github.com/kurnyaannn/kurnyaannn.github.io'
```

2. Then install the Gatsby CLI using [npm](https://npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

```shell
$ npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

3. Extract the cloned/downloaded project
4. Go to directory project

```shell
$ cd {$your_dir}/kurnyaannn.github.io
```

5. Install the dependencies

What ?!</h2>\n<p>Yes. It's the T H E S I S. The BACHELOR's DEGREE T H E S I S. (*spooky sounds in the background*)<br></p>\n<p>Or for Indonesian people better known as 'Skripsi'. which means the final essay i suppose ??. At first i couldn't find the exact same word for Skripsi because it has different meaning in english word, later i found that Skripsi is Thesis. Bachelor's Degree Thesis. In this blog post, i want to share what kind of project that i've made for my bachelor thesis, this is part 0 of i don't know how many blog post this will take, but at least more than one. <br></p>\n<p>\"Why part 0 and not part 1 ?\". Sorry but array start from 0. <br></p>\n<p>I'm not going to be detailed, mostly just the story behind it, but with some explanation about the project as well. So without further ado, let's get into it.</p>\n<h3>The Beginning</h3>\n<p>At first i don't really thinking too much about my thesis, like i don't really think of what kind of project that i want to make, or what kind of problem do i want to solve, i'm just only thinking that this project should be 'easy', not too complicated, nor taking too much time to finish (since i really wanted to graduate ASAP), AND... it has to be <strong>WEB BASED</strong>. Some ideas popped into my head for sure, but i don't really know how to do it the web-way. Until this one Video showed up on my YouTube recommendation. It was video from <a href=\"https://thecodingtrain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">The Coding Train</a> about 'Pose Classification' using Javascript, or to be exact using <a href=\"https://ml5js.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ml5js</a>, i clicked the video for sure, and i'm surprised of how good the explanation was, thanks to <a href=\"https://shiffman.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Daniel Shiffman</a>. Then this idea popped into my head, it was \"<strong>Realtime</strong> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Salah</strong></a> <strong>Pose Detection</strong>\". Not just 'pose', but the correct pose according to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). \"Yes this is it. I think this will do\" or so i thought. Turns out it didn't work as i thought. <br></p>\n<p>Actually the project is working fine, but... only for some poses, and because this model only detect 17 keypoints (only the joints) so it's not so accurate to what it supposed to be, because it needs to detect the hands as well, which currently poseNet unable to do. I'm not giving up yet, so i changed the model using <a href=\"https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/holistic.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Mediapipe Holistic</a> model. But because i have this old laptop, the performance was not that good, i only got 2-3 FPS. So i decided to change the plan. <br></p>\n<p>Because i really like the basic idea of using Javascript to detect object, then i need to find problem that maybe can be solved using this method, and so i found it. It was \"<strong>Realtime Finger Detection for Sign Languange Translator</strong>\". The first thing i did was 'googling' about this project to find out if this kind of project exist, and of course it is exist, but... almost none of them using Javascript as main programming languange, and if they do, none of them able to detect multiple hands at once. This is the challenge, how can i make a program using Javascript that able to detect multiple hands at once and then classify it in realtime. <br></p>\n<p>And FINALLY!!! I have overcome that challenge. <br></p>\n<p>(to be continue)</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"author":"Yayang Kurnia","title":"Hello World","description":"This is my first weblog, so it's kinda special, but. Why \"Hello World\" ?","lang":"ENG","slug":"/blog/hello-world","date":"2021-03-26","tags":["Daily","Programming","Hello World"],"draft":false},"html":"<h2>Hi there!</h2>\n<p>This is my first weblog, so it's kinda special, but. Why \"Hello World\" ? <br></p>\n<p>Because it is SPECIAL. I think almost everyone who knows programming have made \"Hello World\" string\nfor their first compiled program, no matter what programming languange you're using, most likely the\nfirst compiled program is \"Hello World\". It's easy, very simple, and really straightforward. And that's what makes\n\"Hello World\" special. <br></p>\n<p>Enough with the title (well that's not the topic of this blog anyway *lol*). In this blog post\ni want to tell you about this site.</p>\n<h3>Why ?</h3>\n<p>Why am i making this site ? well i'm not 'literally' built this site, this site license is belongs to\n<a href=\"https://brittanychiang.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Brittany Chiang</a> (thanks to her for building this awesome personal site). \"Then who are you ?\"\nMe ? I'm the one who redesigned it, even though not much because i really like the default design of this site, i'm not\neven change the color scheme, just redesign a few components and adding skillsets and blog sections. <br><br>\nAnyway the main reason is because recently i just decided to start working freelance. Actually i have done some freelance works,\nbut just for local client (my friends, my neighbor, etc), but this time i want to try the <a href=\"https://upwork.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Upwork</a> platform,\nwhich is a Global Platform. So in order to gain more attention (even though i'm not having 'real-work' experience) i decided to have personal site.</p>\n<h3>How ?</h3>\n<p>This site is built using <a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Gatsby</a> which based on <a href=\"https://reactjs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ReactJS</a>. And believe it or not,\ni have literally have no idea how to use Gatsby, and also have '0'-knowledge with ReactJS (*lol*). But because i really\nlike this personal site and wanted to have a personal site, so i'm forcing myself to learn about this technologies, and because\nit's basically Javascript based, so it only took me about two to three days to learn. At first i just trying random things,\nthen i  started to understand of how this works (like routing, styling, components, configs, etc).\n<br></p>\n<p>There's something i learned here, about making this site. That if you already know the basic, you will understand the different\nversion of that basic knowledge, or if it was too advanced and you need to learn about that, you're likely will not having any\nissues learning about that. <br></p>\n<h3>Can i use this code for my own website ?</h3>\n<p>Yeah sure. And of course with <strong>attribution</strong>. Linked to the repository or the site itself.</p>\n<h3>How can i install it ?</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Download this project by direcly visiting the <a href=\"https://github.com/kurnyaannn/kurnyaannn.github.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">page</a> or clone this project\nusing git</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong> : The default branch for this repo is '<strong>dev</strong>'.

The BACHELOR's DEGREE T H E S I S. (*spooky sounds in the background*)<br></p>\n<p>Or for Indonesian people better known as 'Skripsi'. which means the final essay i suppose ??. At first i couldn't find the exact same word for Skripsi because it has different meaning in english word, later i found that Skripsi is Thesis. Bachelor's Degree Thesis. In this blog post, i want to share what kind of project that i've made for my bachelor thesis, this is part 0 of i don't know how many blog post this will take, but at least more than one. <br></p>\n<p>\"Why part 0 and not part 1 ?\". Sorry but array start from 0. <br></p>\n<p>I'm not going to be detailed, mostly just the story behind it, but with some explanation about the project as well. So without further ado, let's get into it.</p>\n<h3>The Beginning</h3>\n<p>At first i don't really thinking too much about my thesis, like i don't really think of what kind of project that i want to make, or what kind of problem do i want to solve, i'm just only thinking that this project should be 'easy', not too complicated, nor taking too much time to finish (since i really wanted to graduate ASAP), AND... it's has to be <strong>WEB BASED</strong>. Some ideas popped into my head for sure, but i don't really know how to do it the web-way. Until this one Video showed up on my YouTube reccomendation. It was video from <a href=\"https://thecodingtrain.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">The Coding Train</a> about 'Pose Classification' using Javascript, or to be exact using <a href=\"https://ml5js.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ml5js</a>, i clicked the video for sure, and i'm surprised of how good the explanation was, thanks to <a href=\"https://shiffman.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Daniel Shiffman</a>. Then this idea popped into my head, it was \"<strong>Realtime</strong> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Salah</strong></a> <strong>Pose Detection</strong>\". Not just 'pose', but the correct pose according to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). \"Yes this is it. I think this will do\" or so i thought. Turns out it didn't work as i thought. <br></p>\n<p>Actually the project is working fine, but... only for some poses, and because this model only detect 17 keypoints (only the joints) so it's not so accurate to what it supposed to be, because it needs to detect the hands as well, which currently poseNet unable to do. I'm not give up yet, so i changed the model using <a href=\"https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/holistic.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Mediapipe</a> holistic model. But because i have this old laptop, the performance was not that good, i only got 2-3 FPS. So i decided to change the plan. <br></p>\n<p>Because i really like the basic idea of using Javascript to detect object, then i need to find problem that maybe can be solved using this method, and so i found it. It was \"<strong>Realtime Finger Detection for Sign Languange Translator</strong>\". The first thing i did was 'googling' about this project to find out if this kind of project exist, and of course it is exist, but... almost none of them using Javascript as main programming languange, and if they do, none of them able to detect multiple hands at once. This is the challenge, how can i make a program using Javascript that able to detect multiple hands at once and then classify it in realtime. <br></p>\n<p>And FINALLY!!! I have overcome that challenge. <br></p>\n<p>(to be continue)</p>","frontmatter":{"author":"Yayang Kurnia","title":"My Bachelor Thesis (Part 0)","description":"Yes. It's the T H E S I S.
